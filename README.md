# JavaProfiling-tool

Tool to perform profiling of Java applications and the system they're running on.

## Objective

This project started as a way to facilitate the profiling of the Java applications used within a project. Existing tools fail to provide a single, simple and lightweight method to perform measurements and display these results in a human-readable format.

## Features

- Integration within any Java application
- No need for instatiation, nor having variables passing through your code. Just a **single** code call into a static method
- Secondary tool to do the heavy work of processing the results and creating human-readable graphs

## Requirements

To run both the measurement tool and the processing tool, the following requirements must be met (although earlier versions of the presented software, might work):

- Java Virtual Machine ‚â• 1.6
- Python ‚â• 2.7.5
- Gnuplot ‚â• 4.6.5

**Note:** Since the processing tool is a command line tool, it is assumed that a little bash knowledge has already been acquired.

## Usage

Assuming that all the above requirements are met:

1. The measurement tool should be included in any Java project by importing the file ``cf-javalogger-0.4.5.jar``.
2. According to your system, place in the classpath directory either ``libsigar-amd64-linux.so``, ``libsigar-x86-linux.so`` or ``libsigar-universal64-macosx.dylib``.
3. Import the following into your Java source file.

```java
import static cf.os.javalogger.core.Log.*;
```

4. Perform measurements by performing calls in your code. Bear in mind that you should have a key suffixed by either ***_start*** or ***_stop***, depending wether it's the begin or the termination of a given measurement key.

```java
Boolean stuff = true;
measure("some_stuff_start", "Stuff", "Test 1");
measure("some_stuff_stop", "Stuff", "Test 2", stuff);
closeLogger(); // Should close logger to assert everything was properly flushed. This is only needed ONCE.
```

5. Edit the top of the file ``lp.py``, changing the following variables.

```python
# Where the log files can be found
DIR_PRE = "/home/user/log_files/"
# Subdirectories, in case you produced several measurements
DIR = ["m1", "m2", "m3"]
# Another branch of subdirectories inside which separate different tests (You can leave this list empty)
VPS_COMPS = ["LOGS"]
# Keys to find within log files, without the _start and _stop suffixes
KEYS = ["some_stuff"]
```

6. Run the parser

```bash
$ python lp.py
```
